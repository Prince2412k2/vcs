# `vcs` — your brain’s second favorite version control system

> It’s like `git`, but made from scratch, in Python, by someone who read the Git internals docs _and_ survived.

## Install

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/Prince2412k2/vcs

```

## What is this?

A fully functioning (read: dangerously honest) toy version of Git.

What can do?:

- `init` your repo
- `commit` like a beast
- `log` your glorious past
- `checkout` your mistakes
- `merge` your regrets
- `reset` your bad life choices
- and even `cat-file` things, just because.

No magic. No network. No excuses. Just the raw plumbing Git _wishes_ it could still remember.
